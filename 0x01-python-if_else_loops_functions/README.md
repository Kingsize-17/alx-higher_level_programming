# Python - if/else, loops, functions

In this project, I began utilizing conditionals and loops in Python by using `if`,
`if ... else`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`, and `range` statements with `while` and
`for` loops. I practiced writing my own Python functions while learning about scope of
variables, tracebacks, and arithmetic operators.

At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain:
Why Python programming is awesome
Why indentation is so important in Python
How to use the if, if ... else statements
How to use comments
How to affect values to variables
How to use the while and for loops
How is Python’s for different from C‘s?
How to use the break and continues statements
How to use else clauses on loops
What does the pass statement do, and when to use it
How to use range
What is a function and how do you use functions
What does return a function that does not use any return statement
Scope of variables
What’s a traceback
What are the arithmetic operators and how to use them.
